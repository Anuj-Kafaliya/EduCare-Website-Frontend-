                    <p>
                        This course presents some important vignettes of a complex, highly diverse India that is also
                        witnessing unprecedented changes since its formal independence in 1947 from Great Britain. The
                        lectures revolve around social dimensions of change, the continuing influence of ancient texts
                        on contemporary India, political democracy, economic transition from the state to the market,
                        gender relations, India's economic globalisation and changing world view.

                    <p>
                        Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environments.
                        Geographers explore both the physical properties of Earth’s surface and the human societies
                        spread across it. They also examine how human culture interacts with the natural environment and
                        the way that locations and places can have an impact on people. Geography seeks to understand
                        where things are found, why they are there, and how they develop.

                        easily predict the score in that question.

                        IAS exam. Being a science subject, it is a specialised one, and therefore, only life sciences
                        graduates or doctors (MBBS graduates) are recommended to take up zoology as their optional.
                        The UPSC includes Zoology as an optional subject in the list of 48 optional subjects containing

                        that as it may, there have been a couple of toppers who had taken this optional subject (Gopala
                        Sundara Raj, AIR 5/2011).Botany is exceptionally scoring discretionary subjects in the UPSC IAS
                        Mains test. This is one of the discretionary subjects that the UPSC offers competitors in the

                        optional that comes to mind most easily unlike, say history or public administration. There are
                        very few people taking Geology optional mostly because it is a highly specialised subject.

                        commonly heard language), many candidates, even those who had studied Sanskrit at school, shy
                        away from opting for the Sanskrit optional.
